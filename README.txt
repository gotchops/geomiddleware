HOW TO USE:

First, install the koa, koa-request, and externalip packages using NPM.

I've provided an example file ("example.js") that uses the generator
defined in "geomiddleware.js".

1) In the command prompt, enter the "geomiddleware" folder.

2) Type "node example.js" and hit "Enter".

3) Go to localhost:8000.

You should see text that looks like the following (this is what I get with my geolocation):

Latitude: 43.7545
Longitude: -79.33
Temperature: 294.03 K
Weather code: Clouds
